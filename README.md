## üí° About Authentication

This application uses Laravel Sanctum with Single Page Application (SPA) mode and cookies for authentication. This means that both the frontend and backend projects need to be hosted on the same domain for authentication to work correctly.

### Why Same Domain?

Laravel Sanctum, when used in SPA mode with cookies, relies on the fact that the frontend and backend share the same domain. This allows the backend to set HTTP cookies with authentication tokens that the browser will include with each request. If the projects were on different domains, browsers would treat them as separate entities, preventing the cookies from being sent, and thus authentication would fail.

### Setting Up the Same Domain

Make sure that both the frontend and backend projects are hosted under the same domain. If you're using Docker, ensure that the containers are configured to use the same domain name. If you're setting up manually, configure your server and environment variables accordingly.
